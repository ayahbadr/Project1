      <div>I've been a liar,</br>
        been a </br>
        thief </br>
        Been a lover,</br>
        been a cheat </br>
        All my sins</br>
        need holy water,</br>
        feel it </br>
        washing </br>

        If all it's gonna cause is pain</br>
        Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain</br></br>

      <p class="verse">He's comin' home with his neck</br>
        scratched,</br>
        to catch flack
        Sweat jackets and</br>
        dress slacks,</br>
        mismatched</br>
        On his breath's Jack,</br>
        he's a sex addict</br>
        And she just wants to exact revenge and</br>
        get</br>
        back</br>
        It's a chess</br>
        match,</br>
        she's on his back like a</br>
        jet-pack</br>
        She's kept track of all his Inter</br>
        net chats</br>
        And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next</br>
        Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex</br>
        lacks</br>
        'Cause she loves danger, psychopath</br>
        And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that</br>
        But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back</br>
        Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand</br>
        So she's been on the web lately</br>
        Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man</br>
        And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care</br>
        Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"</br>
        After the first night,</br>
        but tonight I am

        <p class="verse"> One-night stand,</br>
          turned into night staying</br>
          He was calling</br>
          so might scram,</br>
          now we hug tight and</br>
          He found out, now she feels deserted and used</br>
          'Cause he left,</br>
          so what?</br>
          He did it first to her too</br>
          Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that</br>
          we're</br>
          through?</br>
          It's hard to find the words,</br>
          I'm aloof, nervous,</br>
          ensued</br>
          Don’t want us to hurt,</br>
          but what you deserve is the truth</br>
          Don't take it personal,</br>
          I just can't say this in person to you</br>
          So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners</br>
          Don't have to be reserved</br>
          in a booth</br>
          I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's</br>
          Irreversible, I preyed on you</br>
          like it's church at the pew</br>
          And now that I got you I don't want you</br>
          Took advantage in my thirst to pursue</br>
          Why do I do this dirt that I do?</br>
          Get on my soapbox and preach,</br>
          my sermon and speech</br>
          Detergent and bleach is burning the wound</br>
          'Cause now with her in the womb</br>
          We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew</br>
          To use protection 'fore I bit into your
          for</br>
          bidd</br>
          en fruit</br>
          Fuck!

        <p class="verse">Always the bridesmaid, never</br>
          “The bride, hey!”</br>
          Fuck can I say?</br>
          If life was a high</br>
          way</br>
          The seat was an en</br>
          clave,</br>
          I'd be swerving in five</br>
          lanes</br>
          Speeds at a high</br>
          rate, like I'm sliding on ice,</br>
          maybe
          That's why I may have came at you side</br>
          ways</br>
          I can't keep my lies straight</br>
          What I made you ter</br>
          minate, my baby</br>
          This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled</br>
          What else can I say? It was fun for a while</br>
          Bet I really woulda loved your smile</br>
          Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it</br>
          What's one more lie, to tell an</br>
          unborn child?</br>
